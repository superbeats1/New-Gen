🚀 FORCED DEPLOYMENT TRIGGERED
================================
This will force Vercel to rebuild and redeploy with all latest changes.

Wait 2-3 minutes, then:
1. Clear your browser cache completely
2. Open scopa.pro in Private/Incognito mode
3. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)

All mobile fixes should now be live!
